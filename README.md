## Description
Adds a "Clone"button to the "browse" screen of a JIRA issue, allowing to clone it in the browser. Version 2.0 has been developed and tested on Jira 7.8. For newer versions of Jira, please install the script from the master branch.
 
jira-issue-clone provides a workaround for two permission limitations:
- When you don't have the permission to clone a ticket on the JIRA server itself.
- When you want to workaround the problem that the official clone function sets the wrong reporter on the cloned ticket, if you don't have the "Modify Reporter" permission: https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-23538
