# jira-issue-clone
Creates a JIRA ticket in the browser. It provides a workaround for two permission issues:
- When you don't have the permission to clone a ticket on the JIRA server
- When you want to workaround the problem that the official clone function sets the wrong reporter on the cloned ticket, if you don't have the "Modify Reporter" permission: https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-23538
